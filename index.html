            <br><h2>Life Sometimes Sucks</h2>
                <h3>By Brian Tang</h3><br><br><br>
            <h4><em>I wake up in the morning from my short-due sleep</em></h4>
            <h4><em>As I use the restroom, and then head over to eat</em></h4>
            <h4><em>I begrudgingly prepare myself for the day</em></h4>
            <h4><em>Because trying to complete life is no easy feat.</em></h4>
            <br><h4><em>It always has a way of bringing you down</em></h4>
            <h4><em>Every time you try your best to live</em></h4>
            <h4><em>Every good thing comes with some bad</em></h4>
            <h4><em>Taking away more than it can give.</em></h4>
            <br>
            <h4><em>Sometimes I wonder why I even bother to try</em></h4>
            <h4><em>Considering that in the near future, I'll still die.</em></h4>
